# liri-node-app


### -What and Why?-
Liri uses multiple APIs to search for a movie, a song, or a local/non-local music event.


This application comes in particularly handy because it consolidates those media searches into one convenient and lightweight program. It comes with a slew of important information with every search including: 

1. useful metadata

1. album names 

1. artist names and locations


Because of its inherent design, adding to the list of searchable items is very accessible. As a result there is room for easy expansion. 







### -How You Can Use My Program!-

1. So in order to use this app you must install Git:
    https://git-scm.com/downloads

2. After that, you must install Node:
    https://nodejs.org/en/download/

3. Now choose a directory you want everything installed to. Right click the inside of the folder and click on "Git Bash Here". 

4. Clone this repository using git command : 

git clone https://github.com/DAnMaN15726/liri-node-app.git



5. Next, right click in the main folder where the index.js is located and click "Git Bash here".


6. Type in "npm init". You will be prompted to add in metadata for the project. Click -enter- or -return- on your keyboard all the way through until you exit. Adding your own metadata to those prompts not allowed.

7. Type in "npm install", as it will install all necessary packages to get this application
to work.

8. While you are still in git, type "touch .env". 

9. Open this file in whatever IDE you may have. Notepad is fine as well.

    1. OMDB_API_KEY = 
    1. SPOTIFY_API_KEY = 
    1. SPOTIFY_SECRET = 
    1. BANDS_IN_TOWN_API_KEY = 

note: You will have to provide your own keys.


-Now you are done with the install!-




8. In git, type in "node index.js" and the program will launch. 

You will then be walked through your search interests.
